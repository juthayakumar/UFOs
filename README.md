# UFOs
## Overview of Project
  The purpose of this analysis was to create a webpage that will store UFO sighting data, and through JavaScript coding, we created a method to filter data to produce results based certain criteria. 
## Results
  Once the webpage was created, users were able to see a page of information about UFO sightings. This is the startup page:

  Once on the page, users can scroll down and be able to filter out results according to their own desire/criteria. This section shows the filter portion of the page:

  Users can enter a date, country, city, state and/or shape to filter out desired results.
 
## Summary
  One drawback of this new design would be the fact that the search is case sensitive. If a user uses capital letters, they will not get any results. 
  Two recommendations for further development could be to add a drop-down list and click buttons.
